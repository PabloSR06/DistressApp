# DistressApp

## The idea

The main idea consists of making a simple android app to send messages in case of emergency.


The base will consist of two parts:

- An activity to manage the contacts.
- And the other with a button in charge of triggering the messages.

I want to make a useful application using the least internet connection possible, thatâ€™s why the messages are sent as sms.

When this is part is done i want to keep escalating the project with things like:

- GPS info.

- Task to recursive send message a few times,  since the button was pressed.

- Detecting internally or externally if you were in an accident, focus on a motorcycle.

- Start recording for both cameras
